# RadialMenuVR
Physically based radial menu for VR
# Preface:
Manually fine-tuning the animation with animation curves is a standard approach for game animations, but they are time-consuming and it’s a fixed animation!
When dealing with dynamic interactions (more often seen in VR), things must look natural and intuitive, like they do in real life.
One big advantage of numeric springing over animation curves is that it can be dynamic and interactive. For instance, when the springing simulation has not completely come to a stop, and you poke the system (modify the target value or velocity) based on user input, the system can handle it gracefully with numeric springing and everything looks natural. On the other hand, it’s usually hard to interrupt an animation using animation curves and have it animate to a new target value without making it look visually jarring.
Introducing physically based interactive (radial ) menu! This is one of my favorite hobby projects that I've been working on with so much passion. Enjoy and have fun!
